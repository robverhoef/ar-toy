You will need to show an image (arcard.png) to your webcam to make this work.
Showing it from your phone to your desktop webcam might work if there isn't too much reflection on your phone.
Or print it to paper ðŸ¦–.

You can compile your own image here: https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/tools/compile

## Install

- clone
- yarn install
- yarn run dev
- point your browser at http://localhost:5173/ and show your image
- ...hack and add your own spinning logo
